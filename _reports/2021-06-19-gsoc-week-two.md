## Coding Phase

After github automated checks were established, we were workin on package errors and wornings. 
I detected some inconsistent and conflicting namings in some scripts and managed to fix them. With the help of the mentor we also cleared 4 warnings and finally got succesiful testing mark from github.

## Work Progress

1. **test_tumorcomparer.R Error**   
    Status։ **Done**    
    **Issue:** [Files naming issue](https://github.com/sanderlab/tumorcomparer/issues/4)

2. **Package build warnings**  
    Status: **Under Development**  
    **Issue:** [Documentation related warnings](https://github.com/sanderlab/tumorcomparer/issues/5)
