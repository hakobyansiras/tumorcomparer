## Coding Phase

This week I was working on genralization of the run comparison function. The task was to optimize the function and generilize function inputs that comparsion function can get any type of datset. 
Now I am making documentation for the new function, and generating new synthetic datasets to test the function.

## Work Progress

1. **Generalize run_comparison function**   
    Status÷â **Done**    
    **Issue:** [Generalize run_comparison.R Code](https://github.com/sanderlab/tumorcomparer/issues/6)

2. **Generete synthetic dat for testing of the new function**  
    Status: **Under Development**  
    **Issue:** [Make a test for 5 data types](https://github.com/sanderlab/tumorcomparer/issues/10)

3. **Add Documentation to new run_comparison function** 
    Status: **Under Development**   
    **Issue:** [Add Documentation to run_comparison_config_list](https://github.com/sanderlab/tumorcomparer/issues/9)


## Conclusion  

This week was really productive and I have meneged to develop required function which is more optimised and can get any type of datasets.
