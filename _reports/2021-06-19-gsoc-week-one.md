## Coding Phase

This is the period of GSoC where the students work on their projects, with an intention to contribute to the Open Source Community.  
This phase spans until the end of the program. During this period, three evaluations are done to keep a track of the progress the student is making. First evaluation starts from 29th June and the final one marks the end of the program.
