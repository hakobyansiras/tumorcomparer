## Coding Phase

In this week I was getting familiar with package testing and GitHub CI/CD pipelines. In the end of the week I seted up github automated tests for the package with "usethis" package.

## Work Progress

1. **Set up GitHub Actions**  
    Status: **Under Development**  
    **Issue:** [Set up automated CRAN checks for the repository](https://github.com/sanderlab/tumorcomparer/issues/3)

## Conclusion  

This week was really interesting with a lot of new information about package testing and automated github checks.
